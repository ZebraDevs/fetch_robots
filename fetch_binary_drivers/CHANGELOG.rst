0.8.7 (2019-08-06)
------------------

0.8.6 (2019-02-28)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#36 <https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_robots/issues/36>`_ from fetchrobotics/install-laser-filters
  [fetch_drivers] Catkin Install missed laser filters
* Contributors: Alexander Moriarty, Carl Saldanha

0.8.5 (2019-02-26)
------------------
* [FIX] missing laser filter plugins (`#34 <https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_robots/issues/34>`_)
  The drivers work without them, but the robot drives reallly slow.
* Contributors: Alex Moriarty

0.8.4 (2019-02-21)
------------------

0.8.3 (2019-02-15)
------------------
* Add depend urdfdom, and switch to <depend> (`#32 <https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_robots/issues/32>`_)
* Contributors: Alexander Moriarty

0.8.2 (2019-02-15)
------------------
* [fetch_driver] Makefile and mk depend on rospack
  mk uses rospack internally but we don't get the rospack dependency.
  https://github.com/ros/ros/issues/204
  We also call rospack in Makefile.tarball so we should directly depend on
  it instead of assuming it is depended on by ros/core/mk.
* Contributors: Alexander Moriarty

0.8.1 (2019-02-15)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#29 <https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_robots/issues/29>`_ from moriarty/fix-build-deps
  [fetch_drivers] exec_depend -> build_depend
  I left find_package in the CMakeLists.txt for these dependencies.
* Contributors: Alexander Moriarty, Carl Saldanha

0.8.0 (2019-01-30)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#27 <https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_robots/issues/27>`_ from moriarty/fetch-binary-drivers
  [fetch_binary_drivers] new [fetch_drivers] package
* [fetch_drivers] add more dependencies
  All these dependencies are exec_dependencies because this
  package doesn't compile anything.
  They're also in the CMakeLists.txt in the catkin_package and find_package to be safe.
* [fetch_binary_drivers] new [fetch_drivers] package
  This is a new package providing the "fetch_drivers" which was previously
  built internally and distributed as a binary only debian package.
  We will officially announce when the upgrade from Indigo->Melodic is
  ready.
  18.04 and ROS Melodic on the Fetch Research Platforms is still being
  tested.
  The process isn't straight foward as there are calibration files
  which you will want to back-up before the upgrade.
  This `fetch_drivers` package also won't start like it use to because of
  the change from `upstart` to `systemd`.
  That requires `fetch_system_config` which will be open sourced soon.
  This `fetch_binary_drivers` package is part of a plan to distribute
  updates and upgrades to Fetch Research Platform customers faster in the future.
  This relates to `fetchrobotics/fetch_ros#63 <https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_ros/issues/63>`_
  1. An officiall announcement will be made when everything is ready.
  2. We will update and document the process on:
  https://docs.fetchrobotics.com/
  3. We will also announce via our mailing list, ros discourse and post on:
  https://opensource.fetchrobotics.com/

* Fix incorrect virtual function in ChargerStatusGenerator class.
  Virtual function should be collect(void) not collect(double).
  Because base class provided default collect(), there was no compile time error, but diagnostics output for charger was mostly garbage.
  Add "override" to all sub-class virtual function definitions so this would cause a compile time error if this happens again.
  Remove virtual from all sub-class function definitions (it is redudant, and kind silly now that override exists)
